Besides research, I enjoy playing video games, fishing, cooking, and photography. 

## Video Games

<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            DOTA2
            <br>
              I started playing DOTA back to 2013 and have been spending over 10k hours on this game. My favorite position is mid lane and my signature heros are Shadow Fiend and Ember Spirit. Before I began my PhD journey, I hit my personal record MMR of 6.8K and it was ranked around 100 in the NA server. I am very proud of it even though my skills right now regressed a lot due to work and research.

## Fishing and my catches
I was born in Qingdao, a coastal city in northern China. I really like fishing thanks to my dad. When I was a kid my dad used to bringing me to fishing charters a lot. Below are some of my recent catches during my internship in Seattle.

## Cooking
I am foody and love to try cuisines across different regions and countries. After each paper deadline, I usually treat myself by making myself a nice dinner. Below are some dishes that I made from scratch.
