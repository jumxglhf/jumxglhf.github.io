I'm currently a third-year Ph.D. candidate (2020 Summer - Now) in Computer Science and Engineering at the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/), advised by [Dr. Fanny Ye](http://yes-lab.org). Besides, I also work closely with [Dr. Chuxu Zhang](https://chuxuzhang.github.io) from Brandeis University. Before that, I received my B.S. and M.S. at [Case Western Reserve University](https://case.edu), supervised by [Dr. Soumya Ray](http://engr.case.edu/ray_soumya/). 

My research interest lies in graph machine learning and natural language processing. Specifically, for graph machine learning, I am working on semi-supervised and self-supervised node representation learning via graph neural networks. And for natural language processing, I am exploring augmenting langauge models with structured knowledge for various language generation tasks such as open-domain question answering. 

<!-- P.S. I am actively looking for research scientist intern for Summer 2023. If you are interested in hosting me, please send me an email and we can have a talk! -->

News
======
* \[2023.01\] Three papers are accepted to ICLR'23! One first-authored one studies [multi-task self-suerpvised graph learning](https://openreview.net/forum?id=1tHAZRqftM). The others study [large language models for QA](https://openreview.net/forum?id=fB0hRu9GZUS) and [graph adversarial learning](https://openreview.net/forum?id=7jk5gWjC18M). Congrats to everyone involved!
