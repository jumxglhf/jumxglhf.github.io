I am a research scientist in the [User Modeling & Personalization](https://research.snap.com/team/category/user-modeling-and-personalization.html) team at [Snap Research](https://research.snap.com). My work focuses on graph machine learning, recommender systems, representation learning, and user modeling. I expect to receive a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/) in 2024, advised by [Dr. Fanny Ye](http://yes-lab.org). Before that, I received my B.S. and M.S. from [Case Western Reserve University](https://case.edu), supervised by [Dr. Soumya Ray](http://engr.case.edu/ray_soumya/).
